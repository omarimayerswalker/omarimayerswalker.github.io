# Directions

Select two cards and try to make a match. If you don't make a match the two selected cards will reset.

 - The game looks fine on Firefox but the images repeat on Chrome
 - If you click a single card more than once per round the game can break
 - I haven't coded all the user stories

# Technologies

 - CSS
 - JS
